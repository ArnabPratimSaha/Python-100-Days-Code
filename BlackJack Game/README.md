# BlackJack Game

[**Click here**](https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack/) to try out the Blackjack game for yourself

However my version is a bit ***different***.
##### My house rules:
- The deck is unlimited in size. 
- There are no jokers. 
- The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
- The the Ace can count as 11 or 1. The Ace counts as 11 when you get a **BlackJack** and other times as 1. 
- The cards in the deck have equal probability of being drawn.
- Cards are **not removed** from the deck as they are drawn.
- The computer is the dealer.

Do give it a try ðŸ˜„.
